## Verified active work

| Work | Area | State | Dependencies and handoff |
|---|---|---|---|
| Space and Team invitation links | `backend/`, `mobile/`, invitation web pages | Implemented on `feat/workspace-invite-links` (PR #32); reviewed backend/web deployed and healthy. Build 41's native fix passed the user's cold Team and real Safari Space prompt checks. | Build 42 is in preparation with explicit actor-token binding and regressions for account switching and queued different links. 343 backend/133 web/114 mobile tests and clean analysis/typecheck pass; all five CI gates passed on native source `6edb46d`, final-source CI is still required. App Store 1.0.7 draft is manual and unsubmitted; select final build only after Apple validation. Keep Team-only AASA while public build 17 is live. Preserve separate lifecycle work. |
| Flutter UIScene lifecycle migration | `mobile/ios` | Local branch `mobile/flutter-uiscene-migration`; commit `30d5a5e` plus uncommitted changes in Podfiles, Xcode project, and `AppDelegate.swift` | Owner and release status are not recorded. Inspect that worktree before editing these files. Run Flutter analysis/tests, an iOS release build, and physical launch checks before release. |
| App Store recovery and item-photo release | `mobile/` and deployed item-photo backend routes | The public `1.0.6 (17)` source was recovered, build 30 was processed in its internal groups, and item-photo build `1.0.7 (31)` finished App Store Connect processing with `VALID` status on 2026-09-29. | Verify build 31 group assignment and install it from TestFlight. On a physical iPhone, check retained FIND photos plus camera/library add and delete against production. Do not mix the Interior v2 rebuild into this lane. |
| Physical-memory home and durable review | `backend/`, `mobile/`, and matching authenticated web review/home behavior | Branch `feat/physical-memory-home-review` in `/private/tmp/findez-physical-memory`, PR #27; migration `036` and backend/web are deployed. Reference-matching Home and the requested previous rounded four-tab pill are available as build 35 in both internal TestFlight groups. Analysis, all 34 Flutter tests, five CI jobs, Apple validation/processing, and native physical install/launch passed. | Preserve the recovered App Store baseline and separate UIScene worktree. TestFlight-app install and physical capture/photo/auth/revocation checklist remain before calling this production-ready. |
| Reference-matching grounded Ask | Mobile Ask presentation and its additive public answer context | Branch `feat/ask-grounded-reference` in `/private/tmp/findez-ask-reference`, PR #28 stacked on #27. Migration `037` and the selectively deployed backend are live. Build 36 is `VALID` and in both internal TestFlight groups; Apple validation and exact archived physical install/launch passed. All 46 Flutter and 292 backend tests, analysis, and PostgreSQL ownership checks pass. | Home and the previous four-tab pill are unchanged. Hands-on TestFlight install, keyboard/voice, source navigation, ambiguous-project and account-switch acceptance remain unverified. This step does not implement the future memory graph, document retrieval, purchase intelligence, or offline system. |

## Ask photo release

- `feat/ask-fast-photo-questions`, PR #29 stacked on #28, implementation
  `6944ed3`, in `/private/tmp/findez-ask-reference`: the photo-only follow-up is
  complete and the four selected backend files are deployed with exact build-36
  backups preserved. All 327 backend/55 mobile tests, clean Flutter analysis,
  and all five CI test jobs passed. Build `1.0.7 (37)` passed Apple validation,
  native physical install/launch, and processing (`VALID`,
  `APP_STORE_ELIGIBLE`); both internal TestFlight groups are assigned.
  Text-speed work was withdrawn and is excluded. Home, Capture, web, FIND, and
  the restored pill are unchanged. Hands-on camera/library, ownership/uncertainty,
  Review, follow-up and account-switch acceptance remain unverified. Existing
  FIND public-HTTP transport remains a separate security limitation.

## Profile navigation release

- `feat/profile-nav-hub` in `/private/tmp/findez-ask-reference`, based on the
  released build 37. Mobile only: add a fifth circular Profile destination to
  the same inset rounded pill; group account details, settings and existing
  utilities there. Preserve Home, Ask attachments/speed, Capture, Find inventory,
  tutorial page indices, API contracts, backend and existing account actions.
  Implementation, all 66 Flutter tests with coverage and clean analysis are
  complete, with all five CI test jobs passing on `b4aa726` (PR #30). Build
  `1.0.7 (38)` passed Apple validation, upload, `VALID` processing, both internal
  group assignment and native install/launch. Hands-on
  account/settings/camera and TestFlight-app checks remain unverified.

## Profile and Documents polish release

- `fix/profile-documents-polish` in `/private/tmp/findez-ask-reference`, based on
  released build 38. Mobile only: replace cramped account editing with a labeled,
  scrollable form and reliable save/photo actions; use the saved avatar in the
  Profile hub and pill; restyle Documents and its local subflows to the matte
  grouped design. Preserve document API/actions, Home, Ask speed/attachments,
  Capture, Find, settings behavior, backend/web and native lifecycle files. The
  Settings screenshots are visual guidance, not authorization for pretend
  training, retention, offline or export toggles. Implementation `6a0118e` and
  all 94 mobile tests with coverage/clean analysis pass; all five CI jobs are
  green on that exact source (PR #31, stacked on #30). Final build `1.0.7 (39)`
  passed signed archive, Apple validation/upload, `VALID` processing,
  `APP_STORE_ELIGIBLE` and assignment to both internal TestFlight groups. The
  exact final signed app installed and reports build 39. Its launch checks were
  blocked by the locked iPhone; an earlier superseded build-39 binary launched,
  which does not pass the final-binary gate. User unlock was requested. Final
  launch, TestFlight-app installation and hands-on photo/document/account-switch
  acceptance remain unverified. Build-38 archive/IPA are preserved.

## Known blocked product work

| Work | Blocker |
|---|---|
| FIND geometry and training corrections | Unresolved object records, public evidence, review status, uploaded source images, and available crops persist. Masks, geometry, and training-quality correction events still do not persist after FIND job cleanup. |
| Hosted MCP access for remote clients | Current MCP transport is local stdio. A hosted Streamable HTTP service and per-user authentication are not implemented. |
