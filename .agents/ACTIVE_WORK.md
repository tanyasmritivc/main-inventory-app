## Verified active work

| Work | Area | State | Dependencies and handoff |
|---|---|---|---|
| Flutter UIScene lifecycle migration | `mobile/ios` | Local branch `mobile/flutter-uiscene-migration`; commit `30d5a5e` plus uncommitted changes in Podfiles, Xcode project, and `AppDelegate.swift` | Owner and release status are not recorded. Inspect that worktree before editing these files. Run Flutter analysis/tests, an iOS release build, and physical launch checks before release. |
| App Store recovery and item-photo release | `mobile/` and deployed item-photo backend routes | The public `1.0.6 (17)` source was recovered, build 30 was processed in its internal groups, and item-photo build `1.0.7 (31)` finished App Store Connect processing with `VALID` status on 2026-09-29. | Verify build 31 group assignment and install it from TestFlight. On a physical iPhone, check retained FIND photos plus camera/library add and delete against production. Do not mix the Interior v2 rebuild into this lane. |
| Physical-memory home and durable review | `backend/`, `mobile/`, and matching authenticated web review/home behavior | Branch `feat/physical-memory-home-review` in `/private/tmp/findez-physical-memory`, PR #27; migration `036` and backend/web are deployed. Reference-matching Home and the requested previous rounded four-tab pill are available as build 35 in both internal TestFlight groups. Analysis, all 34 Flutter tests, five CI jobs, Apple validation/processing, and native physical install/launch passed. | Preserve the recovered App Store baseline and separate UIScene worktree. TestFlight-app install and physical capture/photo/auth/revocation checklist remain before calling this production-ready. |
| Reference-matching grounded Ask | Mobile Ask presentation and its additive public answer context | Branch `feat/ask-grounded-reference` in `/private/tmp/findez-ask-reference`, PR #28 stacked on #27. Migration `037` and the selectively deployed backend are live. Build 36 is `VALID` and in both internal TestFlight groups; Apple validation and exact archived physical install/launch passed. All 46 Flutter and 292 backend tests, analysis, and PostgreSQL ownership checks pass. | Home and the previous four-tab pill are unchanged. Hands-on TestFlight install, keyboard/voice, source navigation, ambiguous-project and account-switch acceptance remain unverified. This step does not implement the future memory graph, document retrieval, purchase intelligence, or offline system. |

## Ask photo release

- `feat/ask-fast-photo-questions`, PR #29 stacked on #28, implementation
  `6944ed3`, in `/private/tmp/findez-ask-reference`: the photo-only follow-up is
  complete and the four selected backend files are deployed with exact build-36
  backups preserved. All 327 backend/55 mobile tests, clean Flutter analysis,
  and all five CI test jobs passed. Build `1.0.7 (37)` passed Apple validation,
  native physical install/launch, and processing (`VALID`,
  `APP_STORE_ELIGIBLE`); both internal TestFlight groups are assigned.
  Text-speed work was withdrawn and is excluded. Home, Capture, web, FIND, and
  the restored pill are unchanged. Hands-on camera/library, ownership/uncertainty,
  Review, follow-up and account-switch acceptance remain unverified. Existing
  FIND public-HTTP transport remains a separate security limitation.

## Known blocked product work

| Work | Blocker |
|---|---|
| FIND geometry and training corrections | Unresolved object records, public evidence, review status, uploaded source images, and available crops persist. Masks, geometry, and training-quality correction events still do not persist after FIND job cleanup. |
| Hosted MCP access for remote clients | Current MCP transport is local stdio. A hosted Streamable HTTP service and per-user authentication are not implemented. |
